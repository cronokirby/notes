  <p>The deep connections of Music, Art, and Logic.</p>

<h1 id="introduction-a-musico-logical-offering">Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering</h1>

<h2 id="bach">Bach</h2>

<p>The connection between music and the other logical aspects of the bookisn&rsquo;t yet
clear. Out of the three aspects the book talks about,music is the one I&rsquo;m least
familiar with. I have a hard time associatingthe descriptions of different
musical tricks with their actual sounds,but the descriptions of Escher&rsquo;s
paintings ring quite well.The core concept tying in Bach&rsquo;s compositions with the
theme of the bookis self-referentiality. The &ldquo;musical offering&rdquo; described here
is a sprawling canon composed from a single seed melody. The idea of a small
nugget sprawlinga complex system is central to the book&rsquo;s ideas. The structure
of a canon is inherently self referential. Each voice is either an explicit
repetition ofthe main tune, or an isomorphism of that same tune.I&rsquo;m curious as
to how this musical aspect develops.</p>

<h2 id="escher-s-drawings">Escher&rsquo;s drawings</h2>

<p>The part about Escher&rsquo;s drawings spoke to me a bit more.
This is the first time a paradox is introduced to us, in the form of the classical strange
loops.The strange loop seems to be a concept very central to the book. The idea
is that a sequence of steps, while seemingly progressing, can lead us back to
the beginning of that sequence. Escher&rsquo;s drawings often depict
staircases rising up to wrap around themselves.At the core of these loops is
self-referentiality, once again. In order to loop back onto &ldquo;itself&rdquo;, the
staircase needs to be able to connect to &ldquo;itself&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="godel">Godel</h2>

<p>Godel&rsquo;s incompleteness theorems are central to the book, naturally. The key
result is that any axiomatic system rich enough to describe number theory will
have true, but unprovable, statements.</p>

<p>The key technique used by Godel involves the classical paradox:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This sentence is false&rdquo;</p>

<p>by translating that into a formal mathematical statement, you can reach a contradiction.</p>

<p>Recursivity is fundamental to why we can&rsquo;t show that every program terminates.</p>
