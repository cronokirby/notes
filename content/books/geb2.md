# Introduction: A Musico-Logical Offering

## Bach
The connection between music and the other logical aspects of the bookisn't yet
clear. Out of the three aspects the book talks about,music is the one I'm least
familiar with. I have a hard time associatingthe descriptions of different
musical tricks with their actual sounds,but the descriptions of Escher's
paintings ring quite well.The core concept tying in Bach's compositions with the
theme of the bookis self-referentiality. The "musical offering" described here
is a sprawling canon composed from a single seed melody. The idea of a small
nugget sprawlinga complex system is central to the book's ideas. The structure
of a canon is inherently self referential. Each voice is either an explicit
repetition ofthe main tune, or an isomorphism of that same tune.I'm curious as
to how this musical aspect develops.

## Escher's drawings

The part about Escher's drawings spoke to me a bit more.
This is the first time a paradox is introduced to us, in the form of the classical strange
loops.The strange loop seems to be a concept very central to the book. The idea
is that a sequence of steps, while seemingly progressing, can lead us back to
the beginning of that sequence. Escher's drawings often depict
staircases rising up to wrap around themselves.At the core of these loops is
self-referentiality, once again. In order to loop back onto "itself", the
staircase needs to be able to connect to "itself".

## Godel

Godel's incompleteness theorems are central to the book, naturally. The key
result is that any axiomatic system rich enough to describe number theory will
have true, but unprovable, statements.

The key technique used by Godel involves the classical paradox:

"This sentence is false"

by translating that into a formal mathematical statement, you can reach a contradiction.

## Computability
Recursivity is fundamental to why we can't show that every program terminates.
